@1, @2: I fully agree that, by that definition, Ubuntu is a Linux distribution and certainly will be for the foreseeable future.

This article is written under the context of another definition though, as described at the beginning of the article. This article isn't about trying to establish what the term "Linux distribution" really means; it is trying to establish that Ubuntu currently isn't contributing to the Linux software ecosystem as would commonly be expected from most Linux distributions.
