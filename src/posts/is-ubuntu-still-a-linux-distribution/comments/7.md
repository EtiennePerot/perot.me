Technically it *is* a GNU/Linux Distribution, as it uses the Linux Kernel with the GNU libraries/utils etc. Yet I don't think Canonical really want to admit it. They're already calling the Linux Kernel the: "Ubuntu Kernel" now, and I can't see any reference to GNU or Linux (or Debian, for that matter) on their official website, not unless you dig really deep. So yes, in my opinion, Canonical is embarrassed about Linux and GNU, and I predict that in a few years time, they'll completely fork the kernel for themselves, or  start their own kernel from scratch. IMO, I don't mind about Unity, and Ubuntu One, and Ubuntu stores, they're just bundled applications realy. What I *do* care about, is the fact that Canonical and Ubuntu need to embrace and acknowledge their roots, that Ubuntu Linux is a GNU/Linux Distribution which is based upon the Debian GNU/Linux Distribution, not run away from them, and disown them.
