The Perspectives add-on for Firefox solves most of the problems with using HTTPS. For example, the Perspectives "notaries" can tell you if a self-signed certificate is legitimately from the site you are intending to reach. Without Perspectives, that would be difficult or impossible. Even better, if Perspectives has high confidence that the certificate is legitimate, it can automatically bypass the warning messages about it, which makes the operation painlessly automatic. It's advanced certificate validation that's also so easy a Caveman Grandma can do it.
