I am aware of protocol-relative URLs (in fact, this website used to use them extensively); however, that's not the same as the proposed `http-yes-really-i-know-this-is-mixed://`:

* Protocol-relative URLs will request the resource over HTTP if embedded within an HTTP webpage, or they will request the resource over HTTPS if embedded within an HTTPS webpage.
* The proposed `http-yes-really-i-know-this-is-mixed://` only works on HTTPS webpages, and requests the resource over HTTP (hopefully making sure it contains a cryptographic signature in the headers of the response).

From a network perspective, it would be equivalent to embedding an HTTP resource in an HTTPS webpage (i.e. causing a mixed content "error" on purpose). From a browser perspective, it is a way for it to know that the web developer behind the website explicitly *wants* the resource to be loaded over HTTP and not HTTPS, and thereby not have it considered a mixed content error by the browser. Protocol-relative URLs are a way for a web developer to not care whether or not the resource is loaded over HTTP or HTTPS, as long as it doesn't cause a mixed content error. That means the resource would go through HTTPS (along with the overhead that goes with it) if it were embedded on an HTTPS webpage.
