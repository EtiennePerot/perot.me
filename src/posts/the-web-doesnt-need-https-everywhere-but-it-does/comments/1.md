Good article, however I have a little correction for you here:

There is already something like a "http-yes-really-i-know-this-is-mixed://"-scheme which is widly supported (even IE6) and doesn't look like a hack: "//"

When finding a URL like this: "//legit-website.tld/js/jquery.js", the browser will automatically use the loading documents scheme for building the absolute URL used to retrieve the resource.

This concept goes by the name "Protocol Relative URL": [http://www.paulirish.com/2010/the-protocol-relative-url/](http://www.paulirish.com/2010/the-protocol-relative-url/)&nbsp;[https://blog.httpwatch.com/2010/02/10/using-protocol-relative-urls-to-switch-between-http-and-https/](https://blog.httpwatch.com/2010/02/10/using-protocol-relative-urls-to-switch-between-http-and-https/)&nbsp;[http://www.surfingsuccess.com/html/protocol-relative-url.html](http://www.surfingsuccess.com/html/protocol-relative-url.html)
