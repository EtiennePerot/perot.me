Daniel: That's because the message you got is actually an error, not a warning. The script aborted itself because of it, so it didn't write any udev rules, which is why no MAC spoofing occurred.

The reason it considers this message to be an error is because the purpose of this script is to write udev rules for each interface. In order to do that, it needs to find the real (non-spoofed) MAC address of each interface that you have defined macchiato rules for. In order to find those MAC addresses, it requires the network interfaces to exist (at least at the time the script runs).

I have [made the script smarter about this](https://github.com/EtiennePerot/macchiato/commit/40921d12013242ae036993eafae37d210bf87c99), such that it now continues anyway if at least one network interface exists, and the error message is now a lot clearer (it will tell you that MAC spoofing will not be enabled on missing interfaces because it can't find their MAC addresses).

Do a `git pull` again and re-run the script, and this time it should be able to generate rules for `wlan1`. If you want MAC spoofing to work on `wlan0` as well, you will need to enable that interface so that the script can find `wlan0`'s MAC address. You can disable `wlan0` once the script is done running.
