Thanks Etienne

It worked, but in the last step:

	:::console
	brother@DSA-USER ~ $ sudo /usr/share/macchiato/install-udev-rules.sh /etc/macchiato.d
	Configuration file '/etc/macchiato.d/wlan0.sh' found, but network interface 'wlan0' does not exist.

Currently I have only one usb wireless conected (`wlan1`), but i will have another one conected (`wlan0`) (I mean, I will change wireless devices some days, when one of them is very hot - they overheat)
So I made two files as you said, `wlan0.sh` and `wlan1.sh`

Anyway, after this warning I tried it. I rebooted, but it didn't change my actual `wlan1` mac connected right now.

Thanks
