First, I have to thank you for taking the time to help me and all your explanations. Everything works great with my `wlan1` usb wifi device.

But it doesn't work with my `wlan0` device.
When I tested `sudo /usr/share/macchiato/macchiato /etc/macchiato.d` with only `wlan0` connected, it said

	:::console
	ERROR: Can't change MAC: interface up or not permission: Invalid argument
	[wlan0] WARNING: Failed to assign MAC address '4c:0b:3a:6e:02:55'
	[wlan0] Bringing device back up

Anyway, I connected both `wlan0` and `wlan1` devices to generate the rules for all of them.

I then rebooted, and tried with `wlan1` - all worked great

And then again rebooted and tried with `wlan0` but as expected from the test, it didn't change the mac.
It is a `rt2870` usb device, are you aware of some incompatibility with your script?

Thanks again for all your time
