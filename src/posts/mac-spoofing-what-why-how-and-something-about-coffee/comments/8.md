OK I tried this with the same new mac that this device uses in windows (because in Windows I can change its mac)

* `$ sudo macchanger -m 00:11:22:33:44:55:66 wlan0`
* `$ sudo ip link set wlan0 address 00:11:22:33:44:55:66`
* `$ sudo ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55:66`

None of them worked (device up and down, none worked).
When up, it says that I have to down before.
When down it says:

* `ERROR: Can't change MAC: interface up or not permission: Invalid argument`
* `RTNETLINK answers: Invalid argument`
* `SIOCSIFHWADDR: Invalid argument`

Then I tried changing that line in `wlan0.sh`

First to true and rebooted - it didn't change mac

Then removing it completely and rebooted  - it didn't change mac

Don't worry, your script and method works great, and your explanations were very detailed to help me know the problem (this device with this driver can't change its mac)
I will have to investigate if in another distribution it works, who knows.

Just a last pair of questions, for my other working wifi device:

- Do I have to put it always in the same USB port for this to work?
- If I boot linux without the wifi device connected, and then, later I connect it, will it change the mac or is it necessary to always reboot?

Thanks
