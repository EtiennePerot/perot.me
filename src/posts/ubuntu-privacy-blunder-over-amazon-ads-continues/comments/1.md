I liked your article on the dash online search topic, and have been looking
around and talking to some of our ubuntu community in the hope that
there will be some progress that will improve the issue at hand. Now, I don't
have much knowledge about the backend, I am learning as I dig deeper into
it.

I can tell you know more than I do, I sent you [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/VkfnNmo.jpg), which could
be an option as solution, as I found it to be very similar to your idea, I made it
before I read your article.

In short: separation of online search and offline (local) search, by
adding the globe icon on the bottom of the search dash (see picture).

It's very user-friendly, everyone knows that when you choose the globe icon
your query will yield online results and when choosing the home icon it
will show local results only.

What do you think?

I know there is work on the way to resolve it all, so let's hope it's what we
would like to see, to keep ubuntu the best system on the planet to use.
