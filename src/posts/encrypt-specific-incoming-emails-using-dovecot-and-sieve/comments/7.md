R.T.A.: Just create a wrapper script to find out:

	:::bash
	#!/bin/bash
	
	echo "It is $(date) and I am running as $(whoami) and my home is $HOME" > /tmp/gpgit_wrapper.log
	echo "gpg says I have the following keys:" >> /tmp/gpgit_wrapper.log
	gpg --list-keys >> /tmp/gpgit_wrapper.log 2>&1
	echo "Now running gpgit:" >> /tmp/gpgit_wrapper.log
	/path/to/real/gpgit | tee -a /tmp/gpgit_wrapper.log
	returnCode="$?"
	echo "Exitted with return code $returnCode" >> /tmp/gpgit_wrapper.log
	exit "$returnCode"

Have that be called by Dovecot instead of gpgit, then send yourself a message and check what `/tmp/gpgit_wrapper.log` says.

The user running the script does have to have a real home directory in order to store the GPG keys. If you don't want that, I think you can get away with just setting the `GNUPGHOME` environment variable and `gpg` will use that to store its keys instead of `$HOME/.gnupg`.
