Hi Carl,

From the Dovecot wiki

Basic Configuration

This page tells you the basics that you'll need to get a working Dovecot installation.

Find Dovecot configuration file location using:


`doveconf -n | head -n1`

Your configuration file doesn't exist if you installed Dovecot from sources. The config directory should contain a `README` file pointing to an example configuration, which you can use as your basic configuration. For example:

`cp -r /usr/share/doc/dovecot/example-config/* /etc/dovecot/`

The default configuration starts from `dovecot.conf`, which contains an `!include conf.d/*.conf` statement to read the rest of the configuration. This split of configuration files isn't a requirement to use, and it doesn't really matter which `.conf` file you add any particular setting, just as long as it isn't overridden in another file. You can verify with `doveconf -n` that everything looks as you intended.
