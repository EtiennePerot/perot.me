Etienne, thank you for your help! I got it working now!

My main problem was initially a typo, your script put me on the trail.

For anyone wondering how to implement this with virtual users (at least using iRedMail on Debian), the trusted keys needs to be imported to the 'vmail' user. That user doesn't have a home folder of its own, but uses the mail store path of the user receiving email as its home folder. The first email received after activating the script also causes gpg to create its configuration directory under "/var/vmail/x/x/x/x". I then imported the trusted key into the vmail user keyring by prefacing the commands listed in Etienne's guide with [sudo -s /bin/bash vmail -c' commands from guide above']. This does not work for setting the key as trusted though, so when I came to that step, I repeated the key import and set the key as trusted using a normal system user (e.g. root) and then copied the fingerprint with trust status over to the vmail user by following this guide, issuing command #3 there by prefacing with [su etc.] again (http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-users/2009-November/037752.html).

Do you have any idea for a webmail solution that can decrypt the messages attached in a browser?
