"Notice that +vnd.dovecot.filter was added to the sieve_extensions variable, not sieve_global_extensions as recommended on the extprograms plugin page. This is because we want to allow the user to customize the use of those filters."

You can avoid this using the Sieve include extension (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6609). By putting the filter command into a :global included script (from which sieve_global_extensions are accessible), the user can be prevented from direct usage of vnd.dovecot.filter, but he can still control when the filter is applied by including that script where desired. Use global variables to pass any parameters needed to the included script.
