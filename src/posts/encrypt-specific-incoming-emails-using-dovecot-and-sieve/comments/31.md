To comment on the previous suggestions to encrypt the whole email (including the headers), one possibility would be to use [EncFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EncFS) which is powerful nifty tool that can encrypt selected folders or even the whole user homedir. The way it works, the encrypted folder could be either automatically mounted (decrypted) upon login, or manually, using the user's set password. The process could be coupled with some shell scripting or php. So for example when the user logs into his account via roundcube, the server would mount/decrypt his folder so dovecot/postfix could access the emails, and as soon as user logs out, the folder is dismounted and encrypted again. I guess the same process could be applied for POP3/IMAP access. Something to think about. And what's really nice about EncFS, it can be configured to even disallow root any access to potentially decrypt the folder :)
