I've managed to implement this with Ivan Spadacenta solution of applying it globally. I've stumbled upon on "little" problem. dspam isnt able to treat spam mail, because you know, they're encrypted.

We can't force the mail client (unless its a webmail) to decrypt specific messages and save on a different folder.

Any ideas?
