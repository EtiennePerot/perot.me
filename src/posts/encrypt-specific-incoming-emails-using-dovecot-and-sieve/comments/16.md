I'm very grateful for this awesome guide and the precious input and solutions by the other users. Had a bit of frustration to get it working (late night mistakes) but after re-reading carefully all the comments I got it working nicely.
Unfortunately, this works only for Maildir format, I hope in the future there would be support for mbox/mdbox in Dovecot.
