@#11: Sorry, I don't use Debian. I know it's possible though because I know someone who is running such a setup. I don't know if they had to manually compile anything or not.

@#12: My solution is to have the spam filtering be itself part of the Sieve rules, and do that before encrypting the message. I have a little wrapper script at `/etc/dovecot/spamassassin` like so:

	:::console
	#!/bin/sh
	
	exec /usr/bin/vendor_perl/spamassassin -x

And then it can be used in the rules like this:

	:::text
	filter "spamassassin";
	if header :contains "X-Spam-Flag" "YES" {
		fileinto "Spam";
		stop;
	}
	# ... More rules...
	filter "gpgit" "myaddress@example.com";

This way the spam doesn't get encrypted, which is good because it can then be used for training the spam filter. For false negatives (which do get encrypted), I generally move them in the spam folder anyway so that it can learn from the headers.
