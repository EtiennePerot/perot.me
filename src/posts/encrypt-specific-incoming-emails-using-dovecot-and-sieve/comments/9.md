R.T.A.: Not one that would be secure enough to be worth using. There are a bunch of browser extensions out there that can do PGP-in-the-browser (as opposed to PGP-in-the-webpage, which is the worst you can do if your goal is to shield yourself from the server having access to your mail). However, most of those extensions are written to work with Gmail or other popular webmail providers. I would also doubt that they isolate the decrypted payload from the DOM of the webpage itself (as doing so would probably require some tricky rendering majicks to make it look seamless), meaning that the webpage could just use some JavaScript to grab it after t's been decrypted.

*tl;dr*: Just use a real email client.
