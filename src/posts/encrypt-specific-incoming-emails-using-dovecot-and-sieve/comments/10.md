Etienne, good points indeed.

That being said, I'll just chip in that decrypting works using Horde IMP v. 5, I just verified it. That solution requires uploading the private key through Horde so that it is stored server side. One might of course argue that this defeats half the purpose of asymmetric encryption, since both keys are then stored on the server. I will use an email client personally, but if someone goes for Horde, one still needs to enter the private key passphrase to decrypt the emails, so it still adds a layer of encryption security that would have to be broken by someone getting access to the server. Just my 2 cents.

Again, thanks for the guide!
