Lukas: The "sent" folder does not pass through Sieve filters, so there is no way to have Dovecot automatically encrypt it, or at least not using Sieve filtering.

I think the best way to get this working would be to make `encmaildir.sh` work with OpenBSD's `find` implementation, and then set it up to run every once in a while via `cron`.
