Hello, 

first of all, thanks for this howto. The idea is great. but:

i am getting errors to make this work on a debain wheezy. 

	:::text
	managesieve: Fatal: Plugin 'sieve_extprograms' not found from directory /usr/lib/dovecot/modules/sieve
	doveconf: Error: managesieve-login: dump-capability process returned 89
	[....] Restarting IMAP/POP3 mail server: dovecotmanagesieve: Fatal: Plugin 'sieve_extprograms' not found from directory /usr/lib/dovecot/modules/sieve
	doveconf: Error: managesieve-login: dump-capability process returned 89


i am allready using the unstable version of dovecot an managesieved. Does anyone have expierince to set up the plugin in wheezy.

For my observation it seems, that the error is similar to the one on archlinux:
https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/35464?opened=13618&status%5B0%5D=

would be nice, if someone would help
