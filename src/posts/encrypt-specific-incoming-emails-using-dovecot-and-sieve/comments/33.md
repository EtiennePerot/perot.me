Hi Etienne
I'm using gpgit with dovecot as described here. Currently I'm having problems with incoming mails that are signed with PGP/MIME Such mails are encrypted using gpgit. But when I try to open such a mail in my thunderbird+enigmail it ends up in a loop. If the signature is performed with inline pgp then it's no problem to open it in TB after server side encryption done by gpgit
