Hi Denton,

I am still using this system, although this post is a bit outdated on the way to set it up (mostly around the dovecot/sieve setup part).

It is indeed intrinsically flawed in the ways you describe. However, the "postmaster being able to read your email" part isn't much of a concern to me or to most readers of this post, since they presumably already are postmaster on the machine they would be setting this up on.
