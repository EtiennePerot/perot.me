Hi everybody,
I wanted to "force" all user's email to be encrypted (not only single users who choose to use the filter). And to do so I liked tpo use a single script (not a script for every user).

So (helped by Etienne) this is my solution (after all software has been installed). I'm using Debian:
1) In /etc/postfix/master.cf I have:

	dovecot   unix  -       n       n       -       -       pipe
	  flags=DROhu user=vmail:vmail argv=/usr/lib/dovecot/deliver -f ${sender} -d ${user}@${nexthop} -a ${recipient}
	amavis unix - - - - 2 smtp
	        -o smtp_data_done_timeout=1200
	        -o smtp_send_xforward_command=yes


2) In /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf I changed the "plugin" section to:

	:::plain
	plugin {
	    sieve_plugins = sieve_extprograms
	#    sieve_extensions = +vnd.dovecot.filter
	    sieve_global_extensions=+vnd.dovecot.filter
	    sieve_filter_bin_dir = /etc/dovecot/sieve-filters
	    sieve_before = /etc/dovecot/scripts/.sieve
	    sieve_global_dir =/etc/dovecot/scripts
	   sieve=/etc/dovecot/scripts/.sieve
	}

Maybe something is not needed (but this is what I have now)

3) In /etc/dovecot/scripts/ I have a script named .sieve that contains:

	:::plain
	require ["variables", "envelope", "fileinto", "vnd.dovecot.filter"];
	if envelope :matches "to" "*" {
	        set :lower "my_recipient" "${1}";
	        filter "gpgit" "${my_recipient}";
	        fileinto "INBOX";
	}


I changed INBOX.encrypted to INBOX because ALL incoming messages are encripted.
All users public keys are imported in the vmail user's keyring

That's all. hope could help others
