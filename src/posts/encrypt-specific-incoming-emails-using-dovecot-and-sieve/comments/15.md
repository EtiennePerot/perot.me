einsiedlerkrebs: As the error says, it can't find the `sieve_extprograms` plugin file. You either need to compile it yourself, or (if using Pigeonhole 0.4 or above) make sure it is compiled in the right place, using the `--with-moduledir` argument).

If you're installing this from a package for Pigeonhole 0.4 or above, bug your local Debian maintainer to fix it.
