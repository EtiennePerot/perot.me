I have been commenting earlier, that on my debian wheezy server the mechanism didn't work, since pidgeonhole was looking on the wrong place for ext_programms.  
Yesterday with some help i luckily found out, that [i] it was a problem of debians package and [ii] the debian developer fixed it in version dovecotes 2.9.13, which is the testing branch. 

So far, i am happy with that. 

thank you very much for this tutorial. 

eins.
