Hi Etienne,

Are you still using this system (or one like it)? What problems have you met? How have other (not your users)  email correspondents found it?

Clearly, it's intrinsically flawed - not least because it relies on PGP/GPG, which doesn't encrypt RFC*822 headers. But I think it's got to be better than nothing. The default at the moment is that your postmaster can read any of your mail that wasn't deliberately GPG-encrypted by the sender.
