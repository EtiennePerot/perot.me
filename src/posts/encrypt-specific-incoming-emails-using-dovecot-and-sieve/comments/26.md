My user scripts include this

    :::text
    require ["include","variables"];
    # rule:[gpg encypt incoming]
    if header :contains "to" "michael"
    {
    	include :global "gpg";
    }

or this

    :::text
    require ["include","variables"];
    # rule:[smime encypt incoming]
    if header :contains "to" "michael"
    {
    	include :global "smime";
    }

My added Dovecot plugin settings

    :::text
    plugin {
    		sieve_plugins = sieve_extprograms
    		sieve_global_extensions = +vnd.dovecot.filter
    		sieve_filter_bin_dir = /etc/dovecot/sieve-filters
    # Directory for :global include scripts (not to be confused with sieve_global_path).
      # If unset, the include fails.
    		sieve_global_dir = /etc/dovecot/sieve
    }

my *sieve_global_dir = /etc/dovecot/sieve* .sieve scripts
*smime.sieve*

    :::text
    require ["variables", "vnd.dovecot.filter"];
    # rule:[noti3]
    if header :matches "Delivered-To" "*"
    {
            filter "smimeit" "${1}";
    }

*gpg.sieve*

    :::text
    require ["variables", "vnd.dovecot.filter"];
    # rule:[noti3]
    if header :matches "Delivered-To" "*"
    {
            filter "gpgit" "${1}";
    }

This is how I got a user uploadable script that works for roundcube's managesieve plugin for user edits.
