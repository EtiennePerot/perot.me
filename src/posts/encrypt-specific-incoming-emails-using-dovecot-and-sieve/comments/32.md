What would actually need to be done, if I would like to automatically encrypt also all unencrypted outgoing emails? I would like to avoid a cronjob searching through IMAP folders but instead immediately encrypt while writing to the 'sent' folder.

Thanks a lot for this very useful discussion of automatic maildir encryption.
