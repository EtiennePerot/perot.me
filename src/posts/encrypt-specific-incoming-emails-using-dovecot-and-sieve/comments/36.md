[TREES](https://0xacab.org/riseuplabs/trees) and [scrambler](https://github.com/posteo/scrambler-plugin) are plugin for Dovecot to encrypt mailboxes. It still makes sense to encrypt the block device with LUKS but the plugins encrypt the emails with individual keys for each user. Lavabit also released its software [magma](https://github.com/lavabit/magma) under a Free Software license. I would still recommend OpenPGP because the decryption is performed on the computer of the recipient and not the server. The only advantage of software like TREES, scrambler and magma is that they are transparent. You can also argue that they make attacks for difficult.
