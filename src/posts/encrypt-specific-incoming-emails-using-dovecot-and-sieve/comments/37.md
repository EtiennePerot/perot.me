Thanks for the great software. I was able to install that mail encryption on an OpenBSD-Server. Now I would like to encrypt the Sent-Folders, too. Unfortunately the encmaildir.sh script does not work because of OpenBSD's "find" implementation not using regular expressions. 
Is there I way to use just Postfix or Dovecot to encrypt the Sent folder or is it the only or better way to reshape the encmaildir.sh for use on OpenBSD?
