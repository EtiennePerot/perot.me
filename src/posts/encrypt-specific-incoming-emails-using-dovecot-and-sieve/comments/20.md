Yes, only the body of the mail gets encrypted. That is a consequence of using PGP for encryption; that's just how PGP email encryption works. I store email on encrypted storage (a LUKS-mounted partition or other such solution) to partially alleviate this problem. That means that emails can't get delivered after the server reboots for whatever reason, since it doesn't have the key to mount the partition again. For me it's an acceptable risk.

It wouldn't be impossible to design a system where the full email is encrypted, then decrypted with the user's login password (in fact, that's what Lavabit used to do), but I am not aware of any available open-source solution that can do this.
