Dear Etienne, thank you very much for this post, I've been looking for something like this for a while.

I have a debian 7 server set up with postfix+dovecot through iRedMail, and I've followed your setup to the letter, but it still doesn't work This means the email users are virtual, and the user sieve scripts are stored in a subfolder under /var/vmail. I wonder if you have any clues as to how I can import the GPG keys for the unprivileged user actually running the Pigeonhole sieve scripts (I'm not actually sure if this is the 'dovecot', 'vmail' or 'dovenull' user), when this user doesn't have a home folder to store the gpg key info.

Is there anyway to create a log over the output of what happens with the sieve scripts when an email is received?

Any input is appreciated!
