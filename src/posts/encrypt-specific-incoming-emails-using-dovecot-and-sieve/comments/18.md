Actually (after testing) it does work for Maildir/mbox/mdbox formats in Dovecot. It's was the encmaildir.sh that couldn't deal with mbox/mdbox. A workaround to using encmaildir.sh with mdbox for example, is to convert the latter to Maildir format (with dovecot's dsync tool), execute the script, then reconvert back to mdbox.
