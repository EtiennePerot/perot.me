I installed everythink. A little bit different because I am Using Ubuntu 14.04 with Plesk 12. 

I did not compile the extprograms because they should be part of dovecote and pigeonhole in ubuntu 14.04 as far as I know. I found `/usr/lib/dovecot/modules/sieve/lib90_sieve_extprograms_plugin.so`.

I was facing the sam error like Post #14. I solved it by creating an symlink from
`ln -s /usr/lib/dovecot/modules /usr/lib/dovecot/modules/sieve`. 

Then I could restart dovecot without any error. I put the gpgit script directly at `/etc/dovecot/sieve-filters/`. The PGP-pub-key is imported and hast ultimately (5) trust. The Filter is running without errors and moving the Mails to INBOX.encrypted but the mails are not becomming encrypted.

Part from Maillog:
`May  7 13:37:46 kunden dovecot: service=lda, user=info@email-pub-key-exists.com, ip=[]. sieve: msgid=: stored mail into mailbox 'INBOX.encrypted'`

Do you have any ideas? Maybe it is because all files are owned by root? But then there shouldb be a permision error in the log. 

Here are some links to ohter tutorials (maybe helpful for someone):
