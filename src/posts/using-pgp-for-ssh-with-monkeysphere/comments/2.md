I read it through. I don't have hundreds of servers. What couhgt my eye is the cron scipt part. Why? A cronscript. By explaining the problem you used "with loss of a comprimed key. You have to change all authorized_keys files. If you still can get in". Doesn't this apply exactly the same to the timeframe between cron updates when you lose your PGP key? 

When you discover you lost it or got compromised and you revocate it. Between the cronupdates it's fragile. Why not a fresh key update before every ssh login?
