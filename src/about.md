Hi, I'm Etienne Perot, currently a student in Software Engineering at [McGill University].

I like software development, Linux-y things, neat hacks, etc. Sometimes I even [blog about that][perot.me].

I do a fair share of work on [open-source projects][EtiennePerot on GitHub], and I also spend a lot of time helping the [Official Team Fortress Wiki]; you can [find me there][WindPower on Team Fortress Wiki] as well.

For work-related information, you can [read my resume][Etienne Perot CV] or [visit my profile on LinkedIn][Etienne Perot on LinkedIn].

I host a handful of websites:

* [perot.me] (You're looking at it!)
* The [Portal Wiki], which I co-founded
* [wiki.tf], the [Official Team Fortress Wiki] URL shortening domain
* [play.wiki.tf], the [Official Team Fortress Wiki]'s Team Fortress 2 server
* [Biringa] (old personal site; still has a lot of related projects as subdomains)
* [Gaia Tools] and related material

If you need to contact me, the relevant information is on the sidebar.

If you need to message me quickly, you can use [XMPP][Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol] (same address as my email address), or you can send me a message on [IRC][Internet Relay Chat]. I go by the name of **WindPower** on all the networks I am connected to ([Freenode], [OFTC][Open and Free Technology Community], [EFnet], [GeekShed], [GameSurge], [QuakeNet]).

My [PGP][Pretty Good Privacy] key's fingerprint is `5039 F36E E75C CD6E C444 A007 5CFC 3B88 974E E250`. You can [download it here][Etienne Perot PGP key].
