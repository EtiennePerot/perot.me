Hi, I'm Etienne Perot. I like software development, Linux-y things, neat hacks, etc. Sometimes I even [blog about that][perot.me].

I currently work as a [Site Reliability Engineer] at [Google]. The content on this website represent my views, not those of my employer. For more work-related information, you can [read my resume][Etienne Perot CV] or [visit my profile on LinkedIn][Etienne Perot on LinkedIn].

I do a fair share of work on [open-source projects][EtiennePerot on GitHub], and I also spend a lot of time helping the [Official Team Fortress Wiki]; you can [find me there][WindPower on Team Fortress Wiki] as well.

I host a handful of websites:

* [perot.me] (You're looking at it!)
* The [Portal Wiki], which I co-founded
* [wiki.tf], the [Official Team Fortress Wiki] URL shortening domain
* [Biringa] (old personal site; still has a lot of related projects as subdomains, notably the [GLaDOS voice generator])
* [Gaia Tools] and related material

I also operate a number of non-web services, most of which relate to the above websites.

If you need to contact me, the relevant information is on the sidebar.

If you need to message me quickly, you can use [XMPP][Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol] (same address as my email address), or you can send me a message on [IRC][Internet Relay Chat]. I go by the name of **WindPower** on all the networks I am connected to ([Freenode], [OFTC][Open and Free Technology Community], [EFnet], [GameSurge], [QuakeNet]).

My [PGP][Pretty Good Privacy] key's fingerprint is `5039 F36E E75C CD6E C444 A007 5CFC 3B88 974E E250`. You can [download it here][Etienne Perot PGP key].

My [OTR][Off-the-Record Messaging] fingerprint is `A580CE78 A4210989 39235373 35126385 5A2B539D`.
